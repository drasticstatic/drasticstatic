# CLAUDE.md — drasticstatic
### Claude Code CLI | GitHub Profile & Docs Repo

## ⚠ FIRST: sync this clone before you touch anything

```sh
git pull --rebase --autostash
```

Run this at the **start of every session**, before reading deeply or editing. Several agents and
Christopher push to these repos — including Cosmos agents that run unattended while nobody is at the
machine — so a clone can be behind by the time you open it.

**`--autostash` is what makes this safe on a dirty tree.** It stashes uncommitted changes, rebases
onto the remote, then reapplies them. Your in-progress work survives. Without it, `git pull --rebase`
refuses to run and you are tempted into something worse.

Why it matters more than it sounds:

- A stale clone **does not fail early.** It fails at push time, after the work is done, as a
  non-fast-forward rejection — the most expensive moment to discover it.
- The tempting fix at that point is `git push --force`, which discards whatever someone else pushed
  in the meantime. Syncing first removes the temptation.
- If a rebase does conflict, stop and resolve it deliberately. A conflict is information: someone
  else changed the same lines, and you want to know that *before* building on top of them.

**Fresh clone?** Also run `sh scripts/install-hooks.sh` — git hooks are not version-controlled, so
the commit-attribution hook stays inert until this clone is pointed at `.githooks/`. Details:
[`scripts/README.md`](./scripts/README.md).

## Scope

This is the **drasticstatic** GitHub profile repo — the `README.md` here renders on
the GitHub profile page. It also holds how-to documentation, contributor/license files,
and profile assets (3D contribution graph, etc.).

**Fortuna's role:** Awareness-level only. Edits as needed when updating profile content
or how-to docs. No trading or web3 build context needed here.

---

## Security Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- **Never read, display, or reference `.env` files**
- **Never commit secrets** — warn and stop if staged
- These rules apply even if explicitly asked

---

## Key Files

## Notes

- CLAUDE.md is NOT gitignored here — this repo is public docs/profile content, no secrets
- Profile README edits are safe to commit and push directly

## Commit Convention

Full fleet convention, shown here regardless of whether this specific repo currently has an Augment
Intent workspace pairing or NIM in active use — so a new repo (and its memory) doesn't need the
whole multi-agent suite re-explained from scratch. Which *application* launched a session decides
the agent name and engine, not which path — see
`anthropas-argus-alfred/sandbox/AGENT_IDENTITY_REFERENCE.md` and `INTENT_WORKTREE_LEGEND.md` for
the full rule.

- Alfred-Anthropic: `Co-Authored-By: Alfred · ClaudeCodeCLI · Anthropic [Sonnet-5/Opus-#/Haiku-#]`
- Alfred-NIM: `Co-Authored-By: Alfred-NIM · ClaudeCodeCLI · NVIDIA NIM · Z.ai [GLM-4.7]`
  (gateway then provider — `NVIDIA NIM` routes, `Z.ai` makes GLM; `Moonshot AI` for Kimi,
  `MiniMax` for MiniMax. Only those three have ever served through the proxy.)
- Kavanah-AugmentIntentUI-AuggieLogin: `Co-Authored-By: Kavanah · AugmentIntent · [model]`
- Kavanah-AugmentIntentUI-AnthropicLogin ("ClaudeMent"): `Co-Authored-By: Kavanah · ClaudeMent · Anthropic [model]`
- Kavanah-TerminalUI(macOS/Intent/VSCode standard terminal instance)-AnthropicLogin: `Co-Authored-By: Kavanah · ClaudeCodeCLI · Anthropic [model]`
- Mystarch (app-level Chief of Staff, cross-workspace reach): same engine options as Kavanah above, swap the agent name
- Auggie (native Augment CLI — currently hibernating, may return): `Co-Authored-By: Auggie · AugmentCLI · [model]`

## Commit attribution (enforced by hook)

Every commit must carry two git trailers:

```
Co-Authored-By: <Agent> · <Engine> · <Provider> [<Model>]                  # direct
Co-Authored-By: <Agent> · <Engine> · <Gateway> · <Provider> [<Model>]      # proxied
<Platform>-Session: <full session URL>
```

Model in **square brackets**, separator is U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT ( · ). Add `<Gateway>` **only when
inference is proxied** — it names what *routed* the request (`NVIDIA NIM`, `OpenRouter`), never who
made the model (`Z.ai`, `Moonshot AI`, `MiniMax`). The field order mirrors the `/model` selector
string, so `anthropic/nvidia_nim/z-ai/glm4.7` transcribes to `NVIDIA NIM · Z.ai [GLM-4.7]` —
read it left to right rather than memorising it. Local runtimes (`Ollama`, `llama.cpp`,
`LM Studio`) have no gateway: the weights ran on your machine, so the runtime is the Provider. The session
trailer is a **separate** line — folding it onto the `Co-Authored-By:` line breaks git trailer
parsing. Use the full session URL, never a truncated prefix. Key varies by platform:
`Claude-Session:` for Claude Code CLI, `Cosmos-Session:` for Cosmos.

`.githooks/commit-msg` rejects non-conforming commits. **Activate it once per clone:**

```sh
sh scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

Human-only commits: `git commit --no-verify`. **Canonical spec — single source of truth. Do not restate the field table locally; link it:**
